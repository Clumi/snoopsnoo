I had wanted to add several new features to <span class="logo logo-small">SNOOP <img src="/static/img/logo_md.png"> SNOO</span> before I released it publicly, such as letting users authenticate via OAuth, profile views and even more charts and analytics. But after realizing that it would never be _truly_ ready for public release, I bought SnoopSnoo.com, uploaded the current version and posted the link on [/r/InternetIsBeautiful](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/2qucap/a_website_that_shows_interesting_information/) and [/r/dataisbeautiful](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2r3jnk/your_reddit_activity_analyzed_and_visualized_oc/). Both posts were received quite well, and I got a ton of useful feedback from redditors. 


Someone suggested that I crosspost it to [/r/secretsanta](http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/2r7xhr/website_that_shows_interesting_information_about/) - I did and the response was excitingly positive. I hadn't even considered this use case, so it was great to discover new ways people could use the site.

Now, on to actually making use of the feedback I received and make some changes!
