Version 0.2, of course. Since the public release of <span class="logo logo-small">SNOOP<img src="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/img/logo_sm.png" alt="(SnoopSnoo Logo)" width="21" height="10">SNOO</span> ten days ago, I've received lots of feedback that helped me make some important changes. I've just published v0.2 of the site, and I hope to continue to add features and improve accuracy. Here is the list of new features that went live today:

* You can now refresh data to keep your profile up-to-date.
* Client-side fetching of data to prevent "Server too busy" errors.
* See which subreddits are most likely to bring you maximum karma.
* Charts detailing last 60 days of activity.
* All charts updated to use local timezone instead of UTC.
* Help categorize your subreddits.
* Marginally improved NLP.
* Bug fixes and cosmetic changes.
